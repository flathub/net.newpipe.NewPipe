# Unofficial Flatpak distribution metadata for NewPipe

These metadata files are what power the [unofficial NewPipe Flatpak package on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/net.newpipe.NewPipe).

The build step pretty much only glues Android Translation Layer and the latest NewPipe release together. Thus, the real magic happens here:

* https://gitlab.com/android_translation_layer/android_translation_layer/
* https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe

This distribution is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by TeamNewPipe.
